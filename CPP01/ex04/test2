Searches the string for the first occurrence of the sequence specified by its arguments.

When pos is specified, the search only includes characters at or after position pos, ignoring any possible occurrences that include characters before pos.

Notice that unlike member find_first_of, whenever more than one character is being searched for, it is not enough that just one of these characters match, but the entire sequence must match.
